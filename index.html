                         Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names. Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called “Trainers”). During their adventures, Pokémon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon. There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe.</p>

A battle between two Trainers starts when they make eye contact, which players can do by interacting with the other Trainer. When a Pokémon faints in battle, it may cause its opponent to gain experience or effort values. Anthor defintion of pokemon battliing is also: a Pokémon battle in which both Trainers use a full party of six Pokémon. The first Trainer to completely knock out all of the opposing Trainer's Pokémon wins the battle. </p>

                        Trading allows you to exchange Pokémon with your friends and make progress on completing the Pokédex. Trading occurs in-person and in real-time so you'll need to be in close range of your friend in order to trade Pokémon. Every trade requires that you and your trading partner spend some Stardust.One of the many benefits to trading Pokémon with friends is that you have a chance at receiving a Lucky Pokémon. Lucky Pokémon are more likely to be strong opponents in battle, require less Stardust to power up, and appear with a shimmery effect in the Pokédex and on the Pokémon's Summary page. </p>
